A small parser generator written in Go.

This is my unstructured attempt at putting some of the knowledge from a
compiler construction course to use.

The idea is to be able to specify a grammar on something resembling BNF, and
have it spit out something that will build a usable syntax tree, which you can
use in a compiler.

In the end I hope to use it for a compiler I'll write, which I'll use to make an
operating system.
